# City of Milwaukee Library Map

**Overview**

This project utilizes flexdashboard, data from OpenData Milwaukee, and reverse geocoding courtesy of tidygecoder to create an interactive map of Milwaukee Libraries.  Users can filter library locations by ZIP Code and neighborhood.  They can also view library hours and export or print a list of their selections.
